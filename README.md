## Neovim Escpades
So i want to use neovim, its almost addicting in a way. the pursuit to turn my neovim text editor into an IDE is gonna be a great Experience.

### What I Installed:
Plugin Manager: Lazy.nvim: Yes it is very good.
Packaged Underneath: 
ESP Linters for a lot of Languages.

To do: 
Make a starting screen.
